AFRY.

This master thesis aims to assist climate researchers with a program for automated dig-
itization of analogue text archives. To be more precise, getting handwritten text into
machine written text with out manual typing. The user is then be able to further process
the text by summarizing it. The tool is based on the AI-techniques optical character recog-
nition (OCR) and transformers which is a type of neural networks (NN). The motivation
of this study is to contribute to the fight against climate change by simplifying the time
consuming task of manually digitize an analogue file and summarize it, saving time and
making more data available for researchers.
